# Hi, **I'm Neil. ðŸ‘‹**

I am a UI/UX designer who is passionate about universal design.

I specialize in UI, UX, Vue/Nuxt front-end development, digital accessibility, data visualization, and design management. Currently, my main focus is on implementing the "Design for All" concept of universal design in web design.
