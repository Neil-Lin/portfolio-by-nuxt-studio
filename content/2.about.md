# About

## **Intro**

I entered the field of web design in 2013, working on various types of web and app design and development, including government projects, corporate projects, and company product development and maintenance.

In recent years, I have recognized the importance of accessible web design and have shifted my focus to the field of Universal Design in web development.

My design philosophy has always followed the principles of Win-Win and achieving a balanced outcome.
